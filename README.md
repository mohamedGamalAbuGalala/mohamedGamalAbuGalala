**AI Engineer | Full-Stack Engineer | 8+ Years**

Building production-grade AI agent systems, RAG pipelines, and distributed document processing at scale. Currently designing multi-phase LangGraph agent architectures with knowledge graphs and multi-LLM orchestration.

## What I'm Working On

- Multi-phase LangGraph agent systems with graph-enforced tool execution and quality-gated retrieval
- Distributed document processing pipelines (100K+ documents) with circuit breaker resilience
- Neo4j knowledge graphs with entity resolution and validated Cypher query generation
- Multi-LLM orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude) with structured output schemas

## Stack

**AI & Backend:** Python, Django, LangChain, LangGraph, Neo4j, RabbitMQ, OpenAI API

**Full-Stack:** TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, tRPC, PostgreSQL, Redis

**Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Azure

## Highlights
